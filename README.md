# Description:
Cult3 introduces a cutting-edge blockchain solution to fantasy sports, providing an all-encompassing platform for enthusiasts on the Open Web. Users engage in fantasy gaming cults across multiple sports, earning rewards based on the statistical performance of their chosen athletes. Admins can distribute winnings as NFTs, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

The project taps into the booming fantasy sports market, currently valued at $18.6 billion and expected to surge to $48.6 billion by 2027. In India, where the Fantasy Sports sector grows at a remarkable CAGR of 32%, Cult3 anticipates reaching $3.7 billion by 2024.

Blockchain serves as the backbone, addressing centralization and trust concerns. This technology ensures a decentralized, fraud-proof, and transparent system, fostering fairness and accountability. Cult3 stands out by preserving reliability in a decentralized manner, delivering unparalleled transparency to users for an authentic gaming experience.

How it's Made:
Cult3 is crafted using blockchain technology to establish a decentralized and transparent fantasy sports ecosystem. Smart contracts, executed on the blockchain, govern the rules and rewards of each cult, eliminating centralized control and enhancing security.

The platform seamlessly integrates with existing sports data APIs to retrieve real-time statistical information on athletes. This data is then transformed into a point system, determining the performance of virtual teams.

Cult3 leverages Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a form of reward. Admins can seamlessly distribute unique NFTs to users as winnings, providing a tangible and tradable representation of their success.

Partnering with reputable blockchain networks ensures scalability and robustness. The utilization of off-chain storage solutions further optimizes performance, ensuring a seamless user experience.

In addressing potential challenges, Cult3's development team prioritized user education on blockchain technology, ensuring a user-friendly experience. The result is a groundbreaking fantasy sports platform, set to revolutionize the industry with transparency, decentralization, and NFT-based rewards.

# Learnings

The time was a big constraint. I tried to write the smart contracts by myself for the first time and it was a good learning experiance.
